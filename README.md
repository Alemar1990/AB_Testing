# A/B Testing

The most successful companies today are the ones that know their customers so well that they can anticipate their needs. Customer analytics and in particular A/B Testing are crucial parts of leveraging quantitative know-how to help make business decisions that generate value. A/B testing is one of the most important tools for optimizing most things we interact with on our computers, phones and tablets. From website layouts to social media ads and product features, every button, banner and call to action has probably been A/B tested.

## What is A/B testing? 

A/B testing (aka bucket-tests or split-run testing) is a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B, which includes the application of statistical hypothesis testing or two-sample hypothesis testing. The goal of the A/B testing is to compare two versions of a single variable by testing a subject’s response to variant A against B and determining which one is the most effective.

You compare two versions, A and B, of a single variable, which are identical except for one variation that might significantly affect the outcome, say, user behavior. For example, A might be the currently used solution, in this case, it’s called “control,” and B is a modified version of an existing solution, in this case, it’s called “treatment.”

### A/B Testing is important because:

Testing different variables and changes that you make to your project is crucial, otherwise, you’ll never know how effective your changes are or what has essentially caused the difference in the outcome. But A/B testing can do a lot more than prove how changes have impacted the outcome of your solution or, say, marketing campaign or conversion rates. Speaking of A/B testing used in user experience research and website marketing campaigns, it has long-term benefits that ultimately lead to an improvement in user engagement, better content, reduced bounce rates, higher conversion values, and increased sales. Also:

- Removes the need for guessing or relying on intuition
- Provides accurate answers quickly
- Allows for rapid iteration on ideas
- Establishes causal relationships — not just correlations
